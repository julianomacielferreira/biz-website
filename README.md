# Biz Website Tutorial

This is a website template based on the tutorial ["Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o) from Traversy Media&trade;.

The configurations of the file [gulpfile.js](https://github.com/julianomacielferreira/biz-website-tutorial/blob/master/gulpfile.js) are based on the project ["Front-end Boilerplate using Sass and Gulp 4"](https://github.com/thecodercoder/frontend-boilerplate) from [thecodercoder](https://github.com/thecodercoder).
